          ENCAPSULATION:-

   ENCAPSULATION :- IN JAVA IS A PROCESS OF WRAPING CODE AND DATA TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE UNIT,FOR EXAMPLE, A CAPSUAL wHICH IS MIXED OF SERVAL MEDICINES.
  - WE CAN ABLE TO ARCHIVE SECURITY THROUGH ENCAPSULATION
  - WE CAN ARCHIVE DATA HIDING.
  - BY USING GETTER AND SETTER WE CAN MAKE THE DATA READY ONLY OR WERITE ONLY.
  - BY USING GETTER AND SETTER WE CAN HAVE CONTROL OVER THE DATA.

  2. WE CAN CREATE A FULLY ENCAPSULATED CLASS IN JAVA BY MAKING ALL DATA MEMBER OF THE CLASS PRIVATE
  3. BY PROVIDING ONLY A SETTER OR GETTER METHOD,YOU CAN MAKE CLASS READ ONLY OR WERITE ONLY IN ORDER WORD YOU CAN SKIP THE GETTER OR SETTER METHOD.
  4. IT PROVIDES YOU THE CONTROL OVER THE DATA. SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO SET THE VALUE OF ID WHICH SHOULD BE GRETER THEN 100 ONLY , YOU CAN WERITE THE LOGIC INSIDE THE SETTER METHOD
  5. IT IS A WAY TO ARCHIVE DATA HIDING IN JAVA BECUSE OTHER CLASS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACESS THE DATA THROUGH THE PRIVATE DATA MEMBER

 - STATIC VARIABLE OR NON STATIC VARABLE = DATA MEMBER(DATA)
 -  STATIC METHOD OR NON STATIC METHOD = MEMBER FUNCTION (CODE)

 - encapsulation is a one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and involves hiding internal data and implementation detail of a class and providing acess to them througth method.
   it helps in achiving data abstarction and process the data from unauthorised access.
