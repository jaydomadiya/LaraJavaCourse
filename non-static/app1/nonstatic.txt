Non static:-

  .statrting of oopd

  .very impotrance for java programming lang and aslo applicable for other prohramming language.

  . non static means witout static

  . we are mention the veriable ex:-int i;

  .attriute or filed or property.

  .when ever we are creating the object than only non static loaded to the memory.

  . without return non staic can not refreence from a static content without a refrence variable



  . by creating objext we can get the refrence variable.

  . An object is real word entity.

  .class is a blue print to create a objects.

  . object will be heaving  attributes and behaviours.

  .Example :- dog objects property or attributes : age,color,breed,gender,weight

  .behaviours:- bark(),charsecat(),bite(), chasevehicle()

  . properties = data members

  . behaviours:-member function

  . for one class you can able to create any no of object.

  . G g1 = G(class name), g1(reference variable name)(name can be anything)

  .== assigenment opertator (left side assignment)

  .new is keyword and also opreator
  
  . G(); - calling G class no argument constuctor

  .variable , method follow the case like variableNumberOne,methodNumberOne

  .while you are refering to the class case must be same (as a satanderd we will weite) the class name in camel case link Thies IsTheCamelCase

  .object are store inside heap memory

  
  . non static members are loading to the memory while object are created
 
 . all the non static member are loadind to the memory whike we are ceating objects to that particuler class

 . each and every static member (static variable and static method will be shared by all the object of that class.

 . static int oi will be a not loaded while creating the object to K4 class bcz it is already loaded while K4 class is loading.K4 object is just using the already loaded static int i . even the future objects of all K4 class will be using the same copy of static int i
