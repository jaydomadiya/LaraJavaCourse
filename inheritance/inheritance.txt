inharitance

 - the code you provided demonstatct java inheritance. class `b` extends class `A`,which means that `B`,
    inhets the member of A` including the `i` variable in the main method of class `B` an object of types `B` is created and assigned to the variable

 - inharitance is a process of aquiring the properties and behaviours from  another class.  property is data membe // and behaviours is methods

 - by using inheritance we can achive code reuaeblity.

 - inheritance is a fundamental concept in oop that allows class to inherits properties and behaviours from other class.
 
 - one class can able to extend another class at a time.

 - java support single inheritance meaning a class can inherits from only one super class.

 - static vatriable are also inhriting to the sub class from the superclass.

 - by using sub class refrence only we can access static member of subclass. no need of creating object.

 - even by creating object to subclass also we can access static variable.

 -static method also will be inhariting to the sub class.



app2:- composition

instance variable is non static variable
